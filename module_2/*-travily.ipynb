As mentioned, it's easy to sign up and offers a generous free tier. Some lessons (in Module 4) will use Tavily by default but, of course, other search tools can be used if you want to modify the code for yourself."

While LangChain allows you to define chains of computation (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), LangGraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next. Step 1: Define the Graph State First, we define the state structure for our graph. Step 4: Add Nodes to the Graph LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects.',\n",
